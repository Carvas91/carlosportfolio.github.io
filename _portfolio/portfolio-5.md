title: "Automated Decluttering Script"
excerpt: "This project was initiated from a simple realization during a routine check in PowerShell: my Downloads folder was cluttered with an overwhelming number of files. Manually sorting and deleting these files seemed like a daunting task, so I turned to Python and automation to streamline the process..<br/><img src='/images/powershell.png'>"

In this project, the main goal was to create an efficient, automated system for cleaning up the Downloads folder without the need for manual intervention. This was not only to save time but also to implement a solution that could be reused in the future, either on a scheduled basis or as needed.
