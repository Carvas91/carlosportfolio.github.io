I began by loading a grayscale fingerprint image and then inverted the colors to 
make the fingerprint stand out against the background. I applied morphological 
operations to the inverted image: erosion to strip away small bits of noise, 
dilation to emphasize the main features of the fingerprint, opening to smooth 
out the interior structures, and closing to fill in any small gaps. I followed a 
similar approach with a dental X-ray image, starting with a smoothing filter to 
reduce image noise. I then used several edge detection methods, such as Sobel, 
Roberts, Prewitt, and Canny, to draw out the structural details of the images. 
Each technique was chosen for its particular way of highlighting different aspects 
of the image edges.
