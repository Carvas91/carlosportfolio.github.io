🎓 Hi, I'm nearing the end of my AI Master's program and also about to finish my Business Analytics program at Lambton College in Mississauga.

👨‍💻 I've built a strong foundation through formal education, but I didn't stop there. Teaching myself has been one of my biggest strengths. I've gotten really good with Python and essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV and Scikit Learn. I've also gotten hands-on with tools like Power BI, SQL, GitHub, and Google Colab.

📘 Committed to lifelong learning and applying my skills to tackle real-world problems.

🤝 If you're on the lookout for someone who blends school smarts with self-taught know-how, I'm your guy. Don't be shy and feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasconezswett/) or [email me](mailto:carvas91@hotmail.com) about any projects or opportunities.

This is what I can do for your company
======
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: I can analyze data and craft visualizations with Power BI, Excel, or Python, making complex datasets understandable and actionable.
- **Predictive Modeling**: I'm capable of building predictive models, such as linear regression, clustering, and support vector machines, utilizing Python and Scikit-learn to uncover trends and inform decisions.
- **Image Processing**: For image processing tasks, I use OpenCV to perform operations ranging from object detection to image enhancement.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Skilled in using spaCy, NLTK, and TextBlob for text processing to gain insights, such as analyzing comments for sentiment analysis. 
- **Database Management**: I efficiently retrieve and manipulate database information using SQL, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
- **Web Scraping**: My web scraping skills with BeautifulSoup enable me to extract valuable data from websites, providing a rich source of information for analysis.
